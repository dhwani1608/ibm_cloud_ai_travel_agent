AI Travel Planner Agent ✈️
This project is an AI-powered travel assistant developed as part of the IBM Cloud Internship. The agent helps users plan trips efficiently by generating personalized itineraries based on natural language requests. It leverages the power of IBM's Granite Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on the watsonx.ai platform.

This AI Travel Planner Agent simplifies this process into a single, conversational interface. A user can describe their ideal trip—including destination, duration, budget, and interests—and the agent will generate a complete, day-by-day itinerary.
